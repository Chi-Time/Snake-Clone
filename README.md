# Snake-Clone
A short and simple snake clone made within the Unity 5 engine utilizing LinQ. I made the project as simple test of skill and I had always been interested in how to create a snake style game. All code is commented for clarity and beginners.

[Project and WebGl build is made using Unity 3D 5.3.1f]
